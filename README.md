# 520 Toll Lambda Function

I drive from Seattle to Bellevue all the time, very often, through the 520 bridge, which has a toll... a very high toll.

My goal is to know how much is the toll at the time I am passing by to see if it's even worth it. At least that's the jist of it

I am having to write a Lambda function to fetch my data ðŸ˜•
